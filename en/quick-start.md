# Quick Start

PxServ is a platform that provides comprehensive software and hardware support for developers and users who want to develop IoT systems. PxServ enables seamless integration into your projects through APIs and libraries while also offering hardware solutions such as the PxServ Quadro development board (coming soon!).

### Project Development Steps with PxServ

1. **Sign Up for PxServ and Create a Project**\
   Log in to the PxServ platform and create a new project.
2. **Choose Your Development Environment**\
   PxServ is compatible with various programming languages and hardware platforms. It supports the following technologies:
   * Arduino
   * JavaScript / TypeScript
   * Rust
   * ESP32, ESP8266
   * Raspberry Pi
   * Any software or hardware capable of connecting to the internet
3.  **Develop Your Project and Define Data Transmission**\
    Define the data your device will share with PxServ. You can easily develop your project by utilizing the various libraries provided by PxServ:

    * **Arduino Library**
    * **JavaScript / TypeScript Library**
    * **Rust Library**

    For example, in this project, we will use the **Arduino Library since we are using the ESP32 on the Arduino platform.**\


    Below is a sample code that sends data to PxServ using an ESP32 and a DHT11 temperature & humidity sensor:\


    ```cpp
    example code
    ```
